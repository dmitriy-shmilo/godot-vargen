# godot-vargen

This is a simple code generation Godot plugin, which inserts `onready var <node_name>: <node_type> = $"<node_path>` declarations for each selected node.

# Installation

1. Download this repository and add its `addons` contents to your `addons` project folder.
2. Activate VarGen in Project > Project Settings > Plugins

# Usage

1. Once activated, look for VarGen dock with a button (bottom-right dock slot by default). 
2. Select one or more nodes in you scene explorer. 
3. Press the vargen button.

The script will create an `onready var` statement for each selected node, and insert them into the root node's script. Check the output for errors if nothing happens.

# Important

‚ö†Ô∏è This script modifies actual script files on the filesystem, unsaved changes might be lost.
‚ö†Ô∏è This script uses an undocumented API to reload scripts in the editor.

# Known issues

ü™≤ Non-ASCII characters in the node's name will cause incorrect behavior.
